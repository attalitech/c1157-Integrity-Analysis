# TODO

- Add adjustment to SD for number of subjects
- Add ability to download raw data
- Add line by line integrity checks
- Determine categoricals by Integer only and < 6 types
- Permit comments in file
- Results file should only add P values to original file
- Enforce order: Trial ROW (P value) N MEAN SD
- For Observations decimals, just look for OBS. New name will be Round_Observations
- For Mean Dec, just look for an MEAN that does not equal "MEAN"
- Look for rapid rnorm function
- Cutoff for number of categories (probably 5)

# Dean feedback

- I would suggest removing the EXIT button, anyone who wants to quite the app can simply close the window, and it's such a shiny button to click that people may click it without wanting to actually stop their analysis
